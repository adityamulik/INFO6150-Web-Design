    <h2>About Skyscanner Clone</h2>
    <p>
      Skyscanner Clone is a metasearch engine and travel agency based in Edinburgh, Scotland.
      The site is available in over 30 languages and is used by 100 million people per month.
      The company lets people research and book travel options for their trips, including flights, hotels and car hire.
    <br />
      When we started in 2003, we set out to do things differently. We wanted to show all flight options in one place, creating a simple alternative to the confusing sites that make travel feel like hard work.<br/>
      Fast forward to today and we’ve gone from a flight search engine to a global leader in travel. We're proud that more than 100 million people across the world (that's quite a few!) rely on our app and website each month to help them with their travel plans.<br/>
      Dedicated to making travel as simple as possible, we help each and every one of them find the best options across flights, hotels, and car rentals to book the perfect trip.<br/>
      And we’re not stopping there.</p>
