Task:2 - 

Build a weather forecasting application using REACT
Display a 5-day weather forecast, where each day shows the high and low temperatures and an image for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy. Use fake, hard-coded data until youâ€™ve got everything rendering correctly.
Add the ability to click on a day and see its hourly forecast. You can just maintain the current view in the top-level App state.
Add React Router to the project (npm install react-router) and add routes, such that / shows the 5-day forecast, and /[name-of-day] shows the hourly forecast for a particular day.
Sign up for a free API key from https://openweathermap.org/ (Links to an external site.)
Fetch a real 5-day forecast, and feed that data into your app.
